# Basic C Programs Repository

Hello! My name is Omkar Abhishek Jha, a student at Techno International New Town. I have created this repository to store the basic level C programs that are being taught to me in my first year.

This repository is intended to be a resource for other students who are also learning C programming. I hope that the programs stored here will be helpful to you as you learn.

The programs stored in this repository cover a range of basic topics in C programming. Some of the programs included are:

- Hello World program

Each program is stored in its own file with a descriptive name, making it easy to understand what each program does.
